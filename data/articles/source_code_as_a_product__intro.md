mostly self explanatory

source code is the interface that the developers use everyday
explains trends toward serverless (programming all time in console)
   as well as notebook popularity



explain meaning of title
source code is the product because it's the product that you use to build and change the other product
need to change the product? the work involved is a function of the interface of the source code product
interface design becomes really important
how easy is it to make changes to an app? 
so no, when treat src code as prod, it works is not done because it's obviously not the only requirement.
a "product" is obviously non-static. it should do  things. but we treat code as static 

giving due attention. reduce pressure from other places in org to design bad software


### arguments (for why phrase should be used)

1. mental. leads to low code quality because developers treat code as done when it works
   developers that know better can have a hard time defending this.
   source code as product can be a good explanatin
   need holistic view of software not just code in Git

2. reality. source is the tool used to build all software, so the easier it is to use, the more efficient will be the software dev process
2a. onboarding
2b. planning / estimation
2c. bugs from complexity. incidental benefits when forcing software to not just be the stuff that makes other stuff work. 


3. 


*corollary*. dev becomes customer.
